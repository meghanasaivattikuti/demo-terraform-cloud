# Terraform Cloud Demo — ACME Cloud 2.0

This project is a technical demonstration of how **Terraform Cloud (TFC)** can be used to standardize infrastructure provisioning across multiple teams and cloud environments.

It is designed for a mock client — **ACME Corp** — as part of a Cloud 2.0 initiative focused on improving consistency, collaboration and cost efficiency in provisioning workflows.

## Goals

- Demonstrate VCS driven infrastructure provisioning via Terraform Cloud
- Showcase reusable Terraform modules for consistent infrastructure patterns
- Highlight team-based workspace separation
- Use remote backends
- Provision resources across a one cloud enviornment or more
